# Mindovermatter_STM
This repository provides the R code underlying the analysis of the master thesis "Mind over Matter: the Social Representations of Placebos and Their Effects" by Lea LÃ¶sch.

It consists of the following parts: 
- the generation of a text corpus consisting of German news articles from the database Nexis Uni
- the search for the optimal number of topics, *K*, for the structural topic modeling
- text preprocessing, implementation of the structural topic model and estimation of the effects of the publication date on topic prevalence over time
